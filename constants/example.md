# Welcome to the playground

> In case you were wondering what the black box at the bottom is â€“ it's the debug view, showing the current state of the editor. You can disable it by pressing on the settings control in the bottom-left of your screen and toggling the debug view setting.

The playground is a demo environment built with `@lexical/react`. Try typing in **some text** with *different* formats.

Make sure to check out the various plugins in the toolbar. You can also use #hashtags or @-mentions too!
